            techniques and the understanding of the function of the hippocampus in memory
            processing. Specifically, she works on the design and development of conformal
            multi-electrode arrays that can recording neural activities from multiple
            sub-regions of the hippocampus simultaneously from behaving animals and to
            conduct behavioral experiments to study the information transformation
            within the hippocampus tri-synaptic circuit.</p>
